## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-platform.git
cd fraud-detection-platform
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up SQL Database

Execute the provided SQL script to aggregate transaction data and create indices:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p < sql/setup_database.sql
```

### 4. Java Real-Time Fraud Detection Service

Compile and run the Java service to perform rule-based fraud detection.

```bash
cd src/java
javac FraudDetectionService.java
java FraudDetectionService
```

### 5. JavaScript Dashboard

Open `index.html` in your browser to see real-time fraud monitoring.

```bash
open src/javascript/index.html  # On MacOS
start src/javascript/index.html # On Windows
```

### 6. Dockerize and Deploy the Python Model

Use the provided Bash script to build and deploy the Python fraud detection model in Docker:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_model.sh
```

### 7. Configure CI/CD Workflow

Ensure your GitHub repository contains the `ci-cd.yml` workflow file under `.github/workflows/`. This automates testing and deployment.

## üîç How It Works

### 1. **Python: Core Machine Learning Pipeline**

The Python component implements a **Random Forest Classifier** model that detects fraudulent transactions based on historical data. The pipeline includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization of features and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
- **Balancing the Dataset**: Using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle imbalanced data.
- **Model Training**: A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on the preprocessed and balanced data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **ROC AUC** to assess its performance in distinguishing fraudulent transactions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search is used to optimize model parameters for better accuracy.

### 2. **SQL: Data Aggregation and Indexing**

SQL is used to prepare the transaction data for analysis:

- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregating key metrics such as the number of transactions, the total fraud count, average transaction amount, etc., by **customer\_id**.
- **Index Creation**: Creating indexes on critical columns (like **customer\_id**) to speed up query performance.

### 3. **Java: Real-Time Fraud Detection Service**

The Java service performs **real-time fraud detection** based on predefined rules:

- It processes transaction data, checking criteria like **transaction amount** and **location**.
- It returns a **fraudulent** or **legitimate** status based on these rules.

### 4. **JavaScript: Fraud Monitoring Dashboard**

The JavaScript dashboard provides a user interface to monitor the fraud detection system:

- **Transaction Display**: It shows real-time transaction data along with the fraud status (fraudulent or legitimate).
- **Color Coding**: Fraudulent transactions are highlighted in red, and legitimate transactions are displayed in green.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Fetches data periodically from the back-end to update the dashboard in real-time.

### 5. **Bash: Automating Deployment**

The Bash script automates the deployment process of the **Python fraud detection model** using **Docker**:

- **Dockerization**: The Python model is packaged into a Docker container, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Deployment**: The script runs the Docker container on a server, making the fraud detection service accessible at a specified endpoint.

### 6. **YAML: CI/CD Pipeline**

The CI/CD workflow uses GitHub Actions to:

- Run automated tests for Python code.
- Build and push Docker images to a container registry.
- Deploy the application to a production or staging environment.

## üöÄ Deployment

To deploy the platform, follow these steps:

1. Run the Bash script to build and deploy the Docker container.
2. Ensure your GitHub repository is linked to the CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

## üìä Results and Evaluation

- **Machine Learning Model**: The **Random Forest Classifier** performs well with an optimized **ROC AUC score** for distinguishing fraudulent transactions. Further enhancements can be made using more advanced models like **Neural Networks** or **XGBoost**.
- **Real-Time Detection**: The **Java-based service** provides an efficient, rule-based detection mechanism for quick identification of fraud in real-time transactions.

For better performance, the model can be further tuned with techniques like **hyperparameter optimization**, **feature engineering**, or integrating **deep learning models**.
