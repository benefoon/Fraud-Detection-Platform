## How It Works

### Python: Core Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizes features and uses SMOTE to balance the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest and XGBoost model on processed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models with metrics such as Precision, Recall, and ROC AUC.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Grid Search for parameter optimization.

### SQL: Data Aggregation and Indexing

- **Aggregation**: Aggregates metrics like transaction count, fraud count, and average amount.
- **Indexing**: Creates indexes on key columns (e.g., `customer_id`) for faster queries.

### Java: Real-Time Detection

- **Rule-Based Service**: Applies predefined rules to detect fraud based on transaction attributes.
- **Fast Processing**: Optimized for real-time decision-making.

### JavaScript: Fraud Monitoring Dashboard

- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays transaction data and fraud status dynamically.
- **Interactive Features**: Filters by transaction type, time range, and fraud status.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualizes geographic fraud clusters.

### Bash and Docker: Deployment Automation

- **Dockerization**: Packages Python components into a container for consistent deployment.
- **Automation**: Automates build and deployment processes using Bash scripts.

### YAML: CI/CD Pipeline

- **Testing**: Runs automated Python tests for quality assurance.
- **Deployment**: Builds and pushes Docker images to a container registry.
- **Integration**: Automates deployment to production or staging environments.

## Results and Evaluation

| Metric           | Value                  |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **ROC AUC Score** | Optimized for high accuracy |
| **Fraud Detection Latency** | Near real-time (<1s)   |

Further improvements are planned, including advanced neural networks and Kubernetes for scalability.
