# Fraud Detection Platform: Advanced Multi-Language Extension

## üìã Overview

The **Fraud Detection Platform** is a robust and scalable system designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. This platform integrates multiple programming languages and advanced machine learning techniques to ensure high accuracy and quick responses to potential fraud.

Key components include:
- **Python** for machine learning and data preprocessing.
- **SQL** for aggregating and preparing transaction data.
- **Java** for real-time fraud detection services.
- **JavaScript** for building an interactive fraud monitoring dashboard.
- **Bash** for automating deployment through Docker.

## üîç How It Works

### 1. **Python: Core Machine Learning Pipeline**

The Python component implements a **Random Forest Classifier** model that detects fraudulent transactions based on historical data. The pipeline includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization of features and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
- **Balancing the Dataset**: Using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle imbalanced data.
- **Model Training**: A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on the preprocessed and balanced data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **ROC AUC** to assess its performance in distinguishing fraudulent transactions.

### 2. **SQL: Data Aggregation and Indexing**

SQL is used to prepare the transaction data for analysis:
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregating key metrics such as the number of transactions, the total fraud count, average transaction amount, etc., by **customer_id**.
- **Index Creation**: Creating indexes on critical columns (like **customer_id**) to speed up query performance.

### 3. **Java: Real-Time Fraud Detection Service**

The Java service performs **real-time fraud detection** based on predefined rules:
- It processes transaction data, checking criteria like **transaction amount** and **location**.
- It returns a **fraudulent** or **legitimate** status based on these rules.

### 4. **JavaScript: Fraud Monitoring Dashboard**

The JavaScript dashboard provides a user interface to monitor the fraud detection system:
- **Transaction Display**: It shows real-time transaction data along with the fraud status (fraudulent or legitimate).
- **Color Coding**: Fraudulent transactions are highlighted in red, and legitimate transactions are displayed in green.

### 5. **Bash: Automating Deployment**

The Bash script automates the deployment process of the **Python fraud detection model** using **Docker**:
- **Dockerization**: The Python model is packaged into a Docker container, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Deployment**: The script runs the Docker container on a server, making the fraud detection service accessible at a specified endpoint.

## üöÄ Deployment

To deploy the platform, follow the Docker steps to create an isolated environment for running the fraud detection model. The deployment ensures that the model is portable and scalable across different environments.

## üìä Results and Evaluation

- **Machine Learning Model**: The **Random Forest Classifier** performs well with an optimized **ROC AUC score** for distinguishing fraudulent transactions. Further enhancements can be made using more advanced models like **Neural Networks** or **XGBoost**.
- **Real-Time Detection**: The **Java-based service** provides an efficient, rule-based detection mechanism for quick identification of fraud in real-time transactions.
  
For better performance, the model can be further tuned with techniques like **hyperparameter optimization**, **feature engineering**, or integrating **deep learning models**.
